A repo contianing my bachelor thesis

# First time setup

- First download Scenic locally according to [the guide on the website](https://scenic-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

- Install poetry using their [online installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Also install the [poetry shell plugin](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell)

- The first time you open the project, you need to run `poetry install` in your terminal. This should resolve and install all the required dependencies in a new virtual environment.

## Running the Experiments
